A simple minesweeper game that I implemented in Python. I made this project just for trying out Qt5 and for learning a bit on how to build graphical user interfaces in Python.

## Dependencies

The python dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install all of it using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the game

To play the GUI version, run `python gui.py`. If you want to play it in the terminal, run `python tui.py`.

## PyQt5 tutorial

These are some of the resources that helped me build the GUI:
 - Tutorial: https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial
 - Qt5 Docs: doc.qt.io/qt-5
